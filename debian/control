Description: foreign function call libraries - development files
 ffcall is a collection of libraries which can be used to build
 foreign function call interfaces in embedded interpreters.
 .
 The main libffcall library consists of two parts:
 .
    avcall - calling C functions with variable arguments
 .
    callback - closures with variable arguments as first-class C functions
 .
 The avcall and callback modules are also provided as separate
 libraries, but those are deprecated and are installed only for backward
 compatibility.
 .
 Two other libraries are provided:
 .
    vacall - C functions accepting variable argument prototypes
    (non-reentrant variant of part of 'callback')
 .
    trampoline - closures as first-class C functions
    (non-reentrant variant of part of 'callback')
 .
 This package also includes documentation, in HTML format and as manual pages.

Description: foreign function call libraries - main shared library
 ffcall is a collection of libraries which can be used to build
 foreign function call interfaces in embedded interpreters.
 .
 This package installs a shared version of the main libffcall library,
 which consists of two parts:
 .
    avcall - calling C functions with variable arguments
 .
    callback - closures with variable arguments as first-class C functions

Description: foreign function call libraries - calling C functions with variable arguments
 ffcall is a collection of libraries which can be used to build
 foreign function call interfaces in embedded interpreters.
 .
 This package installs a shared library version of the avcall library, which
 can be used for calling C functions with variable arguments.
 .
 The use of this shared library is deprecated. The main libffcall library,
 which embeds avcall, should be preferred.

Description: foreign function call libraries - closures with variable arguments in C
 ffcall is a collection of libraries which can be used to build
 foreign function call interfaces in embedded interpreters.
 .
 This package installs a shared library version of the callback library, which
 provides closures with variable arguments as first-class C functions.
 .
 The use of this shared library is deprecated. The main libffcall library,
 which embeds callback, should be preferred.

Description: foreign function call libraries - closures in C (non-reentrant variant)
 ffcall is a collection of libraries which can be used to build
 foreign function call interfaces in embedded interpreters.
 .
 This package installs a shared library version of the trampoline library,
 which implements closures as first-class C functions. This is a non-reentrant
 variant of part of the 'callback' library.
